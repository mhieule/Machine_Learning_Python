Parameters to consider: number of neighbors (in practice: often from 3 to 5, but should be adjusted), distance measurement between data points

Strengths: - Easy to understand
           - Often gives reasonable performance without a lot of adjustments
           - Used as good baseline method to try before considering more advanced techniques
          
Weaknesses: - Prediction can be low when training set is large (either in num of features or num of samples)
            - Important to pre-process the data
            - Bad perfomance on datasets with many features (>100)
            - Bad perfomance on datasets with most features are 0 most of the time (sparse datasets)
